2. body-writer - 500-800 words maximum
3. conclusion-writer - Next steps or implications
4. content-assembler - Rapid assembly of news article

### Phase 3: Distribution (Parallel)
1. twitter-formatter - Breaking news thread
2. linkedin-adapter - Professional angle

## Orchestration Rules

- MUST use content-assembler for final document assembly
- MUST pass all fragments to content-assembler
- MUST verify assembly completeness before distribution

## Success Metrics
- Time to publish: <30 minutes
- Source verification: 100%
- Social distribution: Immediate
