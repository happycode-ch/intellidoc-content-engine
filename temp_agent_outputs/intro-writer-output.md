# Introduction: AI Agent Development Best Practices

## Hook + Problem Statement (90 words)

What if the secret to AI productivity isn't building smarter agents, but building specialized ones?

Every engineering team faces the same frustration: AI tools promise productivity but deliver complexity. Current AI assistants are like using a race car for both grocery shopping and Formula 1 racing—powerful but inefficient. Teams spend more time wrestling with context switching, inconsistent results, and surprising costs than actually improving their workflows.

The industry keeps asking "How do we make AI more capable?" But Anthropic asked a fundamentally different question: "How do we make AI more efficient through specialization?"

## Alternative Versions

### Version A: Technical Engineer Focus (88 words)
What if the breakthrough in AI productivity isn't about building more powerful models, but about building specialized ones that work together?

If you're an engineer frustrated with current AI tools, you're not alone. GitHub Copilot gives suggestions that need refinement, ChatGPT loses context across conversations, and most AI assistants try to do everything while optimizing for nothing. Your team spends more time managing AI tools than getting value from them.

While the industry chases more capable AI, Anthropic solved a different problem: How do you architect AI agents like professional software components?

### Version B: Problem-First Approach (92 words)
Every engineering team has the same AI adoption story: initial excitement, promising demos, then reality hits. Context gets lost between conversations, suggestions need constant refinement, and costs spiral as teams default to the most powerful models for every task.

Sound familiar? You're experiencing the fundamental flaw in current AI tool design: the Swiss Army knife approach. One model trying to handle everything from code reviews to architecture decisions to simple formatting tasks.

Anthropic recognized this problem and applied a radical solution: What if we treated AI agents like microservices instead of monoliths?

### Version C: Question-Chain Hook (91 words)
What if your AI productivity problem isn't that your tools aren't smart enough, but that they're trying to be too smart?

What if the solution isn't bigger models, but specialized ones? What if the secret is applying software engineering principles we already know work?

Every engineering team faces this: AI tools that promise everything but optimize for nothing. You've seen it—context switching overhead, inconsistent results, unexpected costs when simple tasks trigger expensive model calls. The industry keeps building more powerful AI, but Anthropic asked a different question: How do we build more efficient AI through specialization?
