## Minor Suggestions for Enhancement

### 1. Stylistic Improvements

**Original**: "The industry keeps asking 'How do we make AI more capable?' But Anthropic asked a fundamentally different question:"
**Suggestion**: Consider parallel structure: "While the industry asks 'How do we make AI more capable?' Anthropic asked a fundamentally different question:"
**Rationale**: Creates smoother contrast flow

**Original**: "Think microservices for AI."
**Suggestion**: "Think of it as microservices for AI."
**Rationale**: Slightly more formal register for professional audience

### 2. Technical Precision Enhancements

**Current**: "Research agents run on Haiku, content creators use Sonnet, and complex orchestrators leverage Opus."
**Suggestion**: Add brief explanation: "Research agents run on Haiku for speed, content creators use Sonnet for balance, and complex orchestrators leverage Opus for reasoning power."
**Rationale**: Reinforces the strategic model selection principle

### 3. Flow Optimization

**Current transition**: "The magic happens in model assignment."
**Alternative**: "The strategic advantage lies in intelligent model assignment."
**Rationale**: Maintains professional tone while conveying the same concept
