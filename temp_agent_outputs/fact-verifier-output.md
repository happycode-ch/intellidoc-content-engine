## Performance Claims Requiring Qualification ⚠️

### 1. 70% Cost Reduction
**Claim**: Agent specialization achieves 70% cost reduction
**Verification**: ⚠️ QUALIFIED
**Source**: Mentioned in context but not independently verified
**Qualification**: This appears to be specific to IntelliDoc implementation, not universal guarantee

### 2. 3-5x Speed Improvement
**Claim**: Proper orchestration delivers 3-5x speed improvements
**Verification**: ⚠️ QUALIFIED
**Source**: Referenced in context but specific to IntelliDoc case study
**Qualification**: Results may vary based on implementation and use case
**Recommendation**: Present as case study result, not universal outcome

### 3. 52-Agent IntelliDoc System
**Claim**: IntelliDoc Content Engine uses 52 specialized agents
**Verification**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY VERIFIED
**Source**: Referenced in project context
**Qualification**: This is the current system being discussed, not external validation
**Recommendation**: Present as reference implementation, not third-party case study

## Technical Details Verified ✅

### 1. Agent Communication Protocol
**Claim**: Structured JSON message format for agent handoffs
**Verification**: ✅ VERIFIED
**Source**: Reference document includes complete JSON schema
**Details**: from_agent, to_agent, message_type, payload, metadata structure

### 2. Tool Minimization Principle
**Claim**: Agents should have minimal necessary tools
**Verification**: ✅ VERIFIED
**Source**: Reference document "Tool Minimization" section
**Details**: Examples show specific tool assignments per agent type

### 3. Agent Creation Workflow
**Claim**: 5-step agent creation process
**Verification**: ✅ VERIFIED
**Source**: Reference document "Agent Creation Workflow" section
**Details**: Requirement Gathering → Meta-Agent Invocation → Testing → Refinement → Documentation
