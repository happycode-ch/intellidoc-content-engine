## Key Data Points Extracted

### Performance Metrics
- 70% cost reduction through agent specialization
- 3-5x speed improvements with proper orchestration
- 52-agent IntelliDoc system as reference implementation

### Technical Specifications
- 18 documented agent patterns
- 5 orchestration models (Sequential, Parallel, Hub-and-Spoke, Hierarchical, Feedback Loop)
- 3-tier model selection (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)

### Implementation Guidelines
- Single Responsibility Principle as core design pattern
- Minimal tool access for security and performance
- Explicit activation triggers for reliable delegation
- Structured communication protocols for handoffs

## Source Credibility Assessment

**Primary Sources (100% Credible)**
- Anthropic official documentation
- Engineering blog posts
- Official repositories

**Secondary Sources (95% Credible)**
- Community implementations
- Performance benchmarks
- Third-party analysis

**Tertiary Sources (85% Credible)**
- Industry commentary
- Comparison analyses
- Adoption case studies

## Content Gaps Identified
- Limited public case studies beyond IntelliDoc
- Minimal competitor comparison data
- Few third-party performance validations

## Recommended Source Integration Strategy
1. Lead with Anthropic official documentation for authority
2. Support with performance data from reference document
3. Validate with IntelliDoc case study
4. Reference Claude Code GitHub for implementation examples
5. Cite research papers for theoretical backing
