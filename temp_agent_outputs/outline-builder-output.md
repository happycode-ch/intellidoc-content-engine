# Content Outline: AI Agent Development Best Practices

## I. HOOK + PROBLEM STATEMENT (75-100 words)

### A. Opening Hook
- Question: "What if the secret to AI productivity isn't building smarter agents, but building specialized ones?"
- Universal frustration: Every engineering team's AI adoption challenges

### B. Problem Validation
- Current AI assistants: Swiss Army knife approach (powerful but inefficient)
- Engineering pain points: Context switching, inconsistent results, high costs
- Industry trend: Teams frustrated with AI tool complexity vs. promised productivity

### C. Problem Transition
- Need for different approach to AI agent development
- Bridge to Anthropic's innovative solution

**Word Target**: 90 words

## II. SOLUTION INTRODUCTION (100-125 words)

### A. Anthropic's Different Question
- Instead of "How do we make AI more powerful?"
- Asked: "How do we make AI more efficient through specialization?"

### B. Core Innovation
- Application of Single Responsibility Principle to AI agents
- Software engineering best practices applied to AI development
- Specialization over generalization approach

### C. High-Level Methodology
- Microservices architecture for AI agents
- Task-specific model selection (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)
- Orchestrated agent collaboration vs. monolithic assistance

### D. Credibility Establishment
- Anthropic's engineering-first approach
- Claude Code sub-agent system (July 2025)
- Real-world validation through IntelliDoc implementation

**Word Target**: 115 words

## III. TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE (200-250 words)

### A. Claude Code's 5 Architecture Components (60-70 words)
1. **Identity**: Clear role and expertise definition
2. **Capabilities**: Specific skills and knowledge domains
3. **Constraints**: Boundaries and operational limitations
4. **Interfaces**: Input/output specifications and communication protocols
5. **Quality Gates**: Validation and verification methods

Each agent designed with single responsibility focus

### B. Model Selection Strategy (60-70 words)
- **Haiku**: Simple, deterministic tasks (linting, formatting, basic checks)
  - Fast execution, low cost, high reliability
- **Sonnet**: Standard development (coding, testing, documentation)
  - Balanced performance and cost for most engineering tasks
- **Opus**: Complex reasoning (architecture, security analysis, orchestration)
  - Maximum capability for high-stakes decisions

Strategic assignment based on task complexity, not default to most powerful

### C. Orchestration Patterns (80-90 words)
1. **Sequential Pipeline**: requirements-analyst → architect → developer → tester → reviewer
2. **Parallel Execution**: Frontend, backend, database agents working simultaneously
3. **Hub-and-Spoke**: Central orchestrator managing specialized agents
4. **Hierarchical Delegation**: Multi-level agent management for complex projects
5. **Feedback Loop**: Iterative refinement between developer and reviewer agents

Each pattern optimized for different project types and team structures

### D. Implementation Simplicity (40-50 words)
- YAML-based agent configuration (no complex coding required)
- Declarative agent definition with frontmatter
- Automatic context preservation between agent handoffs
- Built-in communication protocols and message formatting

**Word Target**: 230 words

## IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT (75-100 words)

### A. IntelliDoc Content Engine Case Study
- Real-world implementation of Anthropic's agent development principles
- 52 specialized agents working in orchestrated fashion
- Production system validating theoretical framework

### B. Measurable Results
- **70% cost reduction** through intelligent model selection
- **3-5x speed improvement** via agent specialization and orchestration
- **Consistent quality** through single-responsibility agent design

### C. System Scale Validation
- Content creation pipeline with 10 phases of specialized agents
- Research agents (Haiku) → Content agents (Sonnet) → Review agents (Opus)
- Demonstrates scalability of Anthropic's approach

### D. Industry Implications
- Proves viability of specialized AI agent architecture
- Shows competitive advantage of engineering-first approach
- Validates cost optimization potential

**Word Target**: 85 words
