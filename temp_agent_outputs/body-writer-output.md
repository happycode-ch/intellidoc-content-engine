# Body Content: AI Agent Development Best Practices

## Solution Introduction (115 words)

Anthropic cracked this challenge by applying the Single Responsibility Principle—a cornerstone of software engineering—to AI agent development. Instead of building one AI that tries to do everything, they architected specialized agents that excel at specific tasks and collaborate through structured orchestration.

Think microservices for AI. Each Claude Code agent has a single, well-defined purpose: one reviews code, another handles security auditing, a third optimizes performance. No agent tries to be everything to everyone.

The breakthrough isn't just specialization—it's intelligent model selection. Why use Opus for simple formatting when Haiku delivers the same result at a fraction of the cost? Anthropic's three-tier approach (Haiku for simple tasks, Sonnet for standard development, Opus for complex reasoning) optimizes both performance and economics.

This engineering-first approach transforms AI from expensive generalist assistants into cost-effective specialist teams.

## Technical Deep Dive (230 words)

**Claude Code's 5 Architecture Components**

Every agent follows the same architectural foundation: Identity (clear role definition), Capabilities (specific skills and knowledge domains), Constraints (operational boundaries), Interfaces (standardized input/output protocols), and Quality Gates (validation criteria). This structure ensures each agent knows exactly what it should—and shouldn't—do.

**Strategic Model Selection**

The magic happens in model assignment. Haiku handles deterministic tasks like linting and formatting—fast, reliable, and cost-effective. Sonnet manages standard development work: coding, testing, documentation. Opus tackles complex reasoning: architecture decisions, security analysis, and multi-agent orchestration. Task complexity drives model selection, not default-to-biggest thinking.

**Orchestration Patterns in Practice**

Sequential pipelines work perfectly for feature development: requirements-analyst → architect → developer → tester → reviewer. Parallel execution shines when frontend, backend, and database teams can work simultaneously. Hub-and-spoke patterns excel for code reviews where a central orchestrator manages multiple specialized auditors.

**Implementation Simplicity**

The beauty is in the YAML-based configuration. No complex coding required:

```yaml
---
name: security-auditor
description: Security vulnerability scanning
tools: Read, Grep, Search
model: opus
---
```

Agents automatically preserve context during handoffs, communicate through structured JSON protocols, and maintain audit trails. What took custom framework development now requires simple configuration files.

### Version A: More Technical Detail (245 words)

**Architecture Foundation: Single Responsibility at Scale**

Anthropic's breakthrough came from recognizing that AI agents should follow the same design principles as distributed systems. Each Claude Code agent embodies single responsibility: the security-auditor only scans for vulnerabilities, the test-automator only generates and runs tests, the performance-optimizer only improves efficiency.

This isn't just good organization—it's economics. When your code review agent uses Opus for complex logic analysis but Haiku for style checking, you optimize for both quality and cost. Traditional AI tools use the same expensive model for every operation.

**Orchestration: The Coordination Layer**

Five proven patterns handle different project types:
- Sequential pipelines for dependent tasks
- Parallel execution for independent work streams
- Hub-and-spoke for centralized coordination
- Hierarchical delegation for complex projects
- Feedback loops for iterative refinement

Each pattern includes built-in error handling, progress tracking, and result aggregation. No custom orchestration code required.

**Real Implementation: YAML Configuration**

```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Comprehensive code analysis
tools: Read, Diff, Grep
model: sonnet
---
You analyze code for business logic, security, performance, and maintainability. Return structured feedback with specific line references and improvement suggestions.
```

Context preservation happens automatically. Agents communicate through standardized JSON messages. Setup takes minutes, not weeks of framework development.

### Version B: Business-Focused Approach (225 words)

**The Economics of AI Specialization**

Anthropic solved the fundamental economics problem of AI tools: why pay Opus prices for Haiku work? Their three-tier model selection creates dramatic cost optimization. Simple tasks (formatting, linting) run on Haiku. Standard development (coding, testing) uses Sonnet. Only complex reasoning (architecture, security) requires Opus.

The result? Teams report 70% cost reductions while improving output quality through specialization.

**Engineering Principles Applied to AI**

The Single Responsibility Principle transforms AI from "Swiss Army knife" tools to professional development teams. Each agent has one job and does it exceptionally well. Security auditors focus only on vulnerabilities. Performance optimizers handle only efficiency improvements. Code reviewers examine only quality and maintainability.

This mirrors how successful engineering teams organize: specialists collaborating rather than generalists competing.

**Orchestration: The Missing Link**

Current AI tools fail at handoffs. Context gets lost, decisions lack continuity, and teams waste time re-explaining requirements. Claude Code agents communicate through structured protocols, preserve context automatically, and maintain decision audit trails.

Five orchestration patterns handle different project types: sequential for dependencies, parallel for independent work, hub-and-spoke for coordination, hierarchical for complex projects, and feedback loops for iterative refinement.

Implementation requires YAML configuration, not custom development. Teams focus on defining workflows, not building frameworks.
