Swiss cheese embodies our national identity far beyond the tourist clichés of holey Emmental. In Romandie, we savor our *fromages d'alpage* – mountain cheeses crafted in high-altitude chalets during summer months. From Gruyère AOP to Vacherin Mont-d'Or, each wheel tells a story of terroir and tradition. We don't just eat cheese; we celebrate it through *fondue* gatherings that strengthen community bonds, following the rule "qui perd son pain paie le vin" (whoever drops their bread pays for wine). Our 450 varieties sustain 35,000 jobs and generate 3.5 billion CHF annually. For us, cheese isn't merely food – it's patrimoine, connecting us to our alpine heritage and agricultural roots.
