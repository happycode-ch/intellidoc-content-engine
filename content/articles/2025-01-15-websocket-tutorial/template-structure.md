// Context: What this code does
// Location: Where it goes in the project

[code implementation]

// Result: What happens when this runs
```

### Incremental Code Block
```javascript
// Previous code remains the same...

// NEW: [explanation of changes]
const newFeature = () => {
    // implementation
};

// MODIFIED: [explanation of changes]
existing function() {
    // updated implementation
}
```

### Complete Example Block
```javascript
// Complete working example - [filename.js]
// Save this as: src/[filename.js]

[full file contents]

// Test with: [command to verify]
```

## Learning Progression Template

### Milestone 1: Foundation (25%)
- **Outcome**: Basic server running
- **Code**: 50-75 lines
- **Time**: 15-20 minutes

### Milestone 2: Core Feature (50%)
- **Outcome**: Two users can chat
- **Code**: 150-200 lines
- **Time**: 30-40 minutes  
- **Test**: Real-time message exchange

### Milestone 3: Enhanced (75%)
- **Outcome**: Multiple rooms, user lists
- **Code**: 300-400 lines
- **Time**: 45-60 minutes
- **Test**: Room switching works

### Milestone 4: Production (100%)
- **Outcome**: Error handling, security
- **Code**: 500-600 lines
- **Time**: 60-75 minutes
- **Test**: Handles disconnections gracefully

## Content Flow Template

### Opening Pattern
1. **Hook**: Compelling scenario
2. **Problem**: Why this matters
3. **Solution**: What we'll build
4. **Journey**: Learning path overview

### Section Pattern
1. **Context**: Why this section matters
2. **Concept**: What we're learning
3. **Implementation**: How to build it
4. **Testing**: Verify it works
5. **Enhancement**: Make it better

### Closing Pattern
1. **Summary**: What was accomplished
2. **Extensions**: Ideas for improvement
3. **Resources**: Where to learn more
4. **Community**: How to get help

## Difficulty Progression Strategy

### Cognitive Load Management
- Introduce one new concept per section
- Build on established patterns
- Provide mental models for complex ideas
- Use consistent naming and structure

### Complexity Scaling
1. **Single User**: Echo server (low complexity)
2. **Two Users**: Basic chat (medium complexity)
3. **Multiple Users**: Rooms and features (high complexity)
4. **Production**: Error handling and scale (expert complexity)

### Support Scaffolding
- Code comments explain non-obvious sections
- Diagrams for complex data flows
- Troubleshooting sections after complex implementations
- Complete working examples at each milestone

## Template Advantages for WebSocket Tutorial

### Perfect Match for Technical Content
- Hands-on learning matches developer preferences
- Progressive complexity prevents overwhelm
- Multiple checkpoints ensure success at each stage
- Production focus matches intermediate developer needs

### Addresses Common Failure Points
- Prevents "works on my machine" problems with clear testing
- Handles complexity gradually rather than all at once
- Provides debugging guidance when things go wrong
- Sets realistic expectations for time investment

### Scales Well
- Easy to add sections for advanced features
- Clear structure for community contributions
- Adaptable for different frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)
- Template can be reused for other real-time tutorials

This template structure ensures that intermediate developers can successfully build a production-ready WebSocket chat application while learning the underlying concepts thoroughly.
