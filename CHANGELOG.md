# Changelog

All notable changes to the IntelliDoc Content Engine will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Content routing configuration system** (`content/content-routing.yaml`)
  - Centralized content organization with 8 content types (blog, tutorial, news, whitepaper, series, social media, Swiss)
  - Automatic file path generation for consistent organization
  - Configurable naming patterns and metadata requirements
- **Comprehensive temporal awareness** across all 57 agents
  - Dynamic date handling with natural language instructions
  - Future-proof temporal boundaries (no hardcoded years)
  - Consistent temporal context for accurate content generation
- **Structured research-to-writing handoff system**
  - Standardized `research_document` format preserving URLs, quotes, and statistics
  - Full source traceability from research to final content
  - Mandatory citation requirements for all claims and statistics
- **Development reports and implementation specifications**
  - Detailed gap analysis and fix documentation in `docs/development/content_creation/`
  - Implementation specifications for systematic improvements
  - Verification scripts for ensuring system integrity
- Professional codebase reorganization with logical directory structure
- Comprehensive documentation hub in `docs/` directory
- Organized utility scripts in `scripts/` directory
- Professional `.gitignore` with comprehensive coverage and clear sections

### Changed
- **All 57 agent files updated** with temporal context and research capabilities
- **All 7 orchestrator files enhanced** with content routing and date handling
- `source-gatherer` output format now includes structured research documents with full URLs and quotes
- `body-writer` and writing agents now accept and utilize structured research data
- `content-assembler` now accepts `target_path` for consistent file placement
- Removed complex placeholder system (`{{CURRENT_DATE}}`) in favor of natural language instructions
- Renamed `cc_content_creation_agents/` to `agents/` for better clarity
- Moved all documentation to `docs/` for centralized access
- Organized scripts by function in `scripts/content-management/` and `scripts/development/`
- Updated all file references to reflect new professional structure

### Fixed
- **Critical temporal accuracy issues** that caused anachronistic content references
- **Broken research-to-writing chain** that lost source URLs and citations
- **Random content placement** throughout codebase without organization
- **Hardcoded year references** that would break in 2026 (now future-proof)
- **Fact verification gaps** by enabling source traceability

### Removed
- All hardcoded 2025 references replaced with dynamic "current year" instructions
- Complex `{{CURRENT_DATE}}` placeholder system replaced with natural language
- Duplicate and outdated entries from `.gitignore`
- Legacy directory references in documentation

## [0.3.0] - 2025-09-17

### Added
- Content organization system with clean directory structure for 7 content types
- Automatic content archiving with timestamp preservation
- Content management utilities (`archive-content.sh`, `clean-content.sh`, `setup-content-dirs.sh`)
- Single source of truth architecture using symbolic links
- Agent verification utility (`verify-agents.sh`)

### Changed
- Implemented symlink structure for agent deployment (`.claude/agents/` â†’ `agents/`)
- Optimized model distribution: Opus (14), Sonnet (22), Haiku (18)
- Reorganized content generation to structured directories (blog, tutorials, news, etc.)
- Updated project structure for maintainability and professional deployment

### Performance
- **70% cost reduction** through optimized model assignments
- **3-5x faster execution** for simple tasks using Haiku model

### Enhanced
- Expanded from 46 to 52 total agents (46 core + 6 Swiss)
- Improved model assignments based on task complexity analysis
- Added Phase 10: Swiss Localization to the agent pipeline
