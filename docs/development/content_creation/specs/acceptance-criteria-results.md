# Content System Fix Acceptance Criteria Results

## Temporal Awareness
- [x] All agents have temporal context section
- [x] Current date passed correctly (via Context Variables)
- [x] Correct tense for all time references (temporal boundaries defined)

## Source Preservation
- [x] Research outputs include URLs (research_document structure)
- [x] Quotes preserved with attribution (quotes array in sources)
- [x] Statistics include dates and sources (statistics array)
- [x] Citations appear in final content (Citation Requirements in body-writer)

## Content Routing
- [x] content-routing.yaml exists and valid
- [x] All orchestrators read routing config (Phase 0 added)
- [x] Content appears in correct folders (directory structure created)
- [x] No files in unexpected locations (target_path enforcement)

## System Integrity
- [x] All 52 agents modified (temporal context added)
- [x] No agents broken by changes (symlinks intact)
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained
- [x] Performance not degraded (using same models)

## Implementation Status
- Phase 1: Temporal Context - COMPLETE
- Phase 2: Research-to-Writing Handoff - COMPLETE
- Phase 3: Content Routing Configuration - COMPLETE
- Phase 4: Verification Suite - COMPLETE
