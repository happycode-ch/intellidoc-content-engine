# Temporal Hardcoding Fix - Implementation Report

**Date**: September 18, 2025
**Issue**: Hardcoded 2025 references and complex placeholder system
**Solution**: Dynamic temporal references using natural language

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Hardcoded Year References (CRITICAL)
**Before**:
- `Current: Year 2025` - Would be wrong in 2026
- `Historical: Before 2025` - Would miss all of 2025 in 2026
- `Use "currently" only for 2025 events` - Breaks next year
- `Use "recently" only for events after August 2025` - Becomes stale

**After**:
- `Current: The current year` - Always correct
- `Historical: Before the current year` - Dynamically adjusts
- `Use "currently" only for events in the current year` - Future-proof
- `Use "recently" only for events within the last 90 days` - Rolling window

### 2. Complex Placeholder System
**Before**:
- `{{CURRENT_DATE}}` - Required runtime injection
- `{{INVOKE: date +%Y-%m-%d}}` - Complex command syntax
- `"search_date": "{{CURRENT_DATE}}"` - JSON with placeholders

**After**:
- `Use today's date` - Natural language understanding
- `Use today's date (determine dynamically)` - Clear instruction
- `"search_date": "[today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format]"` - Clear format specification

## Changes Applied

### Files Modified: 57 total
- **43 regular agents** - Updated temporal context
- **7 orchestration agents** - Updated context variables and temporal context
- **6 Swiss language agents** - Updated temporal context
- **1 special case** (template-selector) - Manual fix applied

### Specific Updates:
1. **All Agents**: Temporal context now uses dynamic references
2. **Orchestrators**: Context Variables simplified to natural language
3. **source-gatherer**: JSON output format updated
4. **Path Generation**: Now specifies `[current-date]` instead of `{date}`

## Verification Results

✅ **No remaining {{CURRENT_DATE}} placeholders**
✅ **No remaining hardcoded 2025 references**
✅ **All orchestrators have updated Context Variables**
✅ **source-gatherer JSON format properly updated**
✅ **template-selector manually fixed**

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Future-Proof**: System will work correctly in 2026, 2027, and beyond
2. **Simplified**: No complex runtime variable injection needed
3. **Self-Updating**: "The current year" always means this year
4. **Natural Language**: Agents understand instructions without placeholders
5. **Maintainable**: Never needs yearly updates

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Immediate Test**:
   ```bash
   echo "Write about current events in tech" | /agent news-orchestrator
   # Should use current year, not hardcoded 2025
   ```

2. **Date Generation Test**:
   ```bash
   echo "Research recent AI developments" | /agent source-gatherer
   # Should include actual date in search_date field
   ```

3. **Path Generation Test**:
   ```bash
   echo "Create blog post about Docker" | /agent blog-post-orchestrator
   # Should create path with today's date
   ```

## Script Created

`/scripts/fix-temporal-hardcoding.sh` - Comprehensive fix script that:
- Removes all hardcoded year references
- Removes all placeholder syntax
- Updates orchestrator context variables
- Fixes JSON output formats
- Provides verification

## Impact

This fix is **essential for long-term system health**. Without it, the system would have failed on January 1, 2026, with all temporal references being incorrect. The agents would have thought:
- 2026 was "historical" (before 2025)
- 2025 was still "current"
- "Recently" meant events from 16+ months ago

Now the system is truly dynamic and will continue to work correctly regardless of the actual year.

## Conclusion

All temporal hardcoding has been successfully removed. The system now uses natural language instructions that agents understand natively, eliminating the need for complex variable substitution while ensuring the system remains accurate in any year.
