## Executive Summary
This report provides a comprehensive style guide and consistency checklist for the three-article series on content intelligence, specifically tailored for Swiss business audiences.

## Series Terminology Consistency

### Core Concepts (Must be Consistent Across All Articles)
- **Content Intelligence**: Always capitalize, never hyphenate
- **Content Chaos**: Always capitalize, never use "content disorder" or similar variants
- **Content Machine**: Always capitalize, never use "content system" as substitute

- **CHF**: Always use for currency, never "Fr." or "Swiss francs" in business contexts

### Industry References

## Voice and Tone Consistency

### Professional but Accessible
