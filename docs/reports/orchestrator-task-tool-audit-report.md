# Orchestrator Task Tool Audit Report

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING**: 6 out of 7 orchestrator agents are missing the Task tool, preventing them from functioning as true multi-agent orchestrators. They are operating as powerful single agents instead of orchestrating specialist agent pipelines.

## Audit Results

### ❌ Orchestrators MISSING Task Tool (6)

| Orchestrator | Current Model | Current Tools | Status |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| **tutorial-orchestrator** | sonnet | Read, Write, Bash | ❌ Cannot invoke agents |
| **whitepaper-orchestrator** | opus | Read, Write, WebSearch | ❌ Cannot invoke agents |
| **news-orchestrator** | haiku | Read, Write, WebSearch | ❌ Cannot invoke agents |
| **social-media-orchestrator** | haiku | Read, Write | ❌ Cannot invoke agents |
| **series-orchestrator** | opus | Read, Write | ❌ Cannot invoke agents |
| **swiss-localization-orchestrator** | opus | Read, Write | ❌ Cannot invoke agents |

### ✅ Orchestrators WITH Task Tool (1)

| Orchestrator | Current Model | Current Tools | Status |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| **blog-post-orchestrator** | opus | Read, Write, Task | ✅ WORKING (after fix) |

## Impact Analysis

### What This Means

1. **Not True Orchestrators**: These 6 agents cannot invoke other agents in the pipeline
2. **Single Agent Execution**: They generate all content themselves instead of delegating
3. **Missing Benefits**:
   - No specialist agent expertise utilized
   - No parallel processing capabilities
   - No true pipeline execution
   - Higher cognitive load on single agent
   - Less consistent quality across sections

### Performance Implications

**Current (Broken) Behavior**:
- Single agent does all work
- Faster execution (1-2 minutes)
- Lower token usage
- Less specialized output
- Missing quality checks from specialist agents

**Intended (With Task Tool) Behavior**:
- 15-30+ specialist agents collaborate
- Slower execution (3-5 minutes)
- Higher token usage but better results
- Each section optimized by specialists
- Multiple quality validation layers

## Required Updates

### 1. Tutorial Orchestrator
```yaml
# Current (BROKEN)
model: sonnet
tools: Read, Write, Bash

# Required (FIXED)
model: opus  # Better orchestration
tools: Read, Write, Task, Bash  # Add Task tool
```
**Agents to orchestrate**: ~25 agents for comprehensive tutorials

### 2. Whitepaper Orchestrator
```yaml
# Current (BROKEN)
model: opus  # Model is correct
tools: Read, Write, WebSearch

# Required (FIXED)
model: opus
tools: Read, Write, Task, WebSearch  # Add Task tool
```
**Agents to orchestrate**: ~30 agents for authoritative content

### 3. News Orchestrator
```yaml
# Current (BROKEN)
model: haiku  # Too simple for orchestration
tools: Read, Write, WebSearch

# Required (FIXED)
model: opus  # Upgrade for orchestration
tools: Read, Write, Task, WebSearch  # Add Task tool
```
**Agents to orchestrate**: ~10 agents for rapid news creation

### 4. Social Media Orchestrator
```yaml
# Current (BROKEN)
model: haiku  # Too simple for orchestration
tools: Read, Write

# Required (FIXED)
model: sonnet or opus  # Upgrade for orchestration
tools: Read, Write, Task  # Add Task tool
```
**Agents to orchestrate**: ~8 agents for platform optimization

### 5. Series Orchestrator
```yaml
# Current (BROKEN)
model: opus  # Model is correct
tools: Read, Write

# Required (FIXED)
model: opus
tools: Read, Write, Task  # Add Task tool
```
**Agents to orchestrate**: ~20 agents per episode with continuity

### 6. Swiss Localization Orchestrator
```yaml
# Current (BROKEN)
model: opus  # Model is correct
tools: Read, Write

# Required (FIXED)
model: opus
tools: Read, Write, Task  # Add Task tool
```
**Agents to orchestrate**: 6 Swiss language specialists

## Model Recommendations

### Why Model Matters for Orchestrators

**Opus (Recommended for all orchestrators)**:
- Better instruction following
- Complex context management
- Multi-step reasoning
- Agent coordination capabilities

**Current Issues**:
- `news-orchestrator` uses haiku (too simple)
- `social-media-orchestrator` uses haiku (too simple)
- `tutorial-orchestrator` uses sonnet (adequate but not optimal)

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority** (Core functionality):
   - tutorial-orchestrator (high usage, complex pipeline)
   - whitepaper-orchestrator (complex, long-form content)
   - series-orchestrator (multi-part coordination)

2. **Medium Priority** (Important features):
   - news-orchestrator (rapid content needs)
   - social-media-orchestrator (distribution critical)

3. **Specialized**:
   - swiss-localization-orchestrator (specific use case)

## Validation Requirements

After updates, each orchestrator must:

1. **Invoke specified agents via Task tool**
2. **Show multiple agent executions in logs**
3. **Pass context between agents**
4. **Produce assembled output from fragments**
5. **Demonstrate longer execution times** (proving multi-agent work)

## Conclusion

The IntelliDoc Content Engine's sophisticated 52-agent architecture has been operating at ~15% capacity due to missing Task tool configuration. Only the blog-post-orchestrator (after our fix) actually orchestrates agents. The other 6 orchestrators are powerful single agents masquerading as orchestrators.

**Immediate Action Required**: Add Task tool to all orchestrators and upgrade haiku models to opus/sonnet for proper orchestration capabilities.
