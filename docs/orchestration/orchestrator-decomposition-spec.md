# Claude Code Specification: Decompose Monolithic Orchestrator into Specialized Sub-Orchestrators

## Context
You are reviewing a content creation system with 41 specialized agents organized in 9 phases. Currently, a single 386-line orchestrator (`content-pipeline-orchestrator.md`) manages ALL workflows, violating the single-responsibility principle. Your task is to decompose this into specialized orchestrators following Anthropic's best practices.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Workflows in Repository
The current orchestrator defines these workflows:

1. **Technical Blog Posts** (11 agents)
   - Pipeline: topic-scout → source-gatherer → fact-verifier → content-planner → outline-builder → intro-writer → body-writer → code-example-writer → conclusion-writer → grammar-checker → flow-optimizer

2. **Quick News Articles** (6 agents)
   - Pipeline: source-gatherer → fact-verifier → intro-writer → body-writer → conclusion-writer → twitter-formatter

3. **Step-by-Step Tutorials** (6 agents)
   - Pipeline: topic-scout → step-sequencer → concept-explainer → code-example-writer → exercise-designer → solution-provider

4. **Social Media Distribution** (4 agents)
   - Pipeline: content-atomizer → twitter-formatter → linkedin-adapter → instagram-packager

5. **Comprehensive Guide** (25-30 agents)
   - Uses most agents across all phases for maximum depth

## Anthropic Best Practices to Apply

From `subagents-implementation-report.md`:

### Core Principles
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each orchestrator handles ONE content type
2. **Clear Boundaries**: No overlap between orchestrator responsibilities  
3. **Minimal Tool Access**: Only tools needed for orchestration (Read, Write)
4. **Explicit Workflows**: Hardcode agent sequences for each content type
5. **Context Isolation**: Each orchestrator maintains its own context

### Orchestration Patterns to Use
- **Prompt Chaining**: Sequential task decomposition
- **Parallelization**: Run independent agents simultaneously
- **Orchestrator-Worker**: Central coordinator assigns tasks

## Implementation Instructions

### Step 1: Validation
1. Review each orchestrator specification above
2. Verify it matches existing workflow patterns in the repository
3. Confirm single-responsibility adherence
4. Check that agent sequences are logical

### Step 2: File Creation
1. Create each orchestrator as a separate `.md` file
2. Place in `.claude/agents/` directory
3. Ensure YAML frontmatter is valid
4. Test each orchestrator individually

### Step 3: Deprecation Plan
1. Keep `content-pipeline-orchestrator.md` temporarily
2. Mark as deprecated in description
3. Remove after new orchestrators are validated

### Step 4: Testing Protocol
For each orchestrator:
```bash
# Test explicit invocation
/agent blog-post-orchestrator
"Create a technical blog post about Docker containers"

# Verify agent sequence triggers correctly
# Monitor which agents activate and in what order
```

## Architecture Validation Checklist

For EACH orchestrator, verify:
- [ ] Single content type responsibility
- [ ] 100-200 lines maximum
- [ ] Clear agent sequence defined
- [ ] No overlap with other orchestrators
- [ ] Appropriate model selection (haiku/sonnet/opus)
- [ ] Minimal tool access (Read, Write only)
- [ ] Success metrics defined
- [ ] Orchestration rules explicit

## Expected Outcomes

### Before (Monolithic)
- 1 orchestrator × 386 lines = 386 lines total
- Mixed responsibilities
- Difficult to modify
- Single point of failure

### After (Specialized)
- 6 orchestrators × ~150 lines = 900 lines total
- Single responsibilities
- Easy to modify individually
- Isolated failure domains

### Benefits
1. **Maintainability**: Change blog workflow without affecting tutorials
2. **Testability**: Test each workflow in isolation
3. **Performance**: Load only needed orchestrator
4. **Clarity**: Each orchestrator's purpose is obvious
5. **Scalability**: Add new orchestrators without touching others

## Final Verification

After implementing all orchestrators, verify the system still handles:
- [ ] Technical blog posts with code examples
- [ ] Quick news articles under 30 minutes
- [ ] Step-by-step tutorials with exercises
- [ ] Social media content distribution
- [ ] Long-form white papers
- [ ] Multi-part content series

Each should work BETTER than before due to specialized focus.

## Note on Anthropic Alignment

This decomposition follows Anthropic's documented best practices:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each orchestrator does one thing
- **Transparency**: Clear, deterministic workflows
- **Tool Design**: Minimal necessary access
- **Context Preservation**: Isolated contexts per orchestrator

This is the CORRECT architecture according to Anthropic's own guidelines.
