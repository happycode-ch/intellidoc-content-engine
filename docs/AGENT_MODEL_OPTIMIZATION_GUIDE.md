## Monitoring & Optimization

### Quality Metrics to Track
1. **Output Quality Score**: Ensure no degradation from model changes
2. **Execution Time**: Monitor speed improvements
3. **Error Rate**: Track any increase in failures
4. **Cost per Content Piece**: Measure cost reduction

### Rollback Plan
If quality issues are detected:
1. Identify affected agents
2. Revert model assignment in agent .md file
3. Document issue for future reference
4. Consider intermediate model (Sonnet) if Haiku insufficient

## Future Optimizations

### Potential Further Refinements
1. **Dynamic Model Selection**: Based on content complexity
2. **Hybrid Approaches**: Using multiple models in single agent
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Automated quality checks
4. **A/B Testing**: Compare model performance on same tasks

### Continuous Improvement Process
1. Weekly review of agent performance metrics
2. Monthly cost-benefit analysis
3. Quarterly model assignment review
4. User feedback integration
