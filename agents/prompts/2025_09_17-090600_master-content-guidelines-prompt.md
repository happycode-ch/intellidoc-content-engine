# CONTENT CREATION DIRECTIVE

## CRITICAL QUALITY STANDARDS - READ FIRST
This content must meet Swiss business excellence standards:
1. Every example must be authentic or clearly marked as illustrative
2. Every statistic must be verifiable or marked as projected
3. Every claim must be achievable with current technology
4. Every section must provide value, not just describe problems
5. Every output must respect Swiss business cultural norms

STOP and REVISE if any of these standards are not met.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
[Define the specific content project, target audience, and strategic objectives. Be explicit about content type, market focus, and business goals.]

## PIPELINE SELECTION INTELLIGENCE
Based on content type identified above, ENGAGE the appropriate agent subset:

### Content Type → Pipeline Mapping
- **Blog Post** (8-12 agents): Research → Strategy → Content Creation → QA → Assembly
- **Tutorial** (12-15 agents): Planning → Step-sequencer → Interactive Elements → Code Examples → QA → Assembly
- **News Article** (5-7 agents): Rapid Research → Quick Creation → Assembly → Distribution
- **Social Media** (5-8 agents): Content Atomization → Platform Adaptation → Scheduling
- **White Paper** (20-25 agents): Deep Research → Authority Building → Technical Depth → Citations → Assembly
- **Email Sequence** (6-9 agents): Strategy → Personalization → Sequence Creation → CTA Optimization
- **Case Study** (10-12 agents): Research → Narrative Building → Data Visualization → Assembly
- **Product Description** (7-10 agents): Feature Analysis → Benefit Translation → SEO Optimization → Variants
- **Executive Summary** (4-6 agents): Extraction → Condensation → Business Framing → Polish
- **Comprehensive Report** (30-35 agents): Full Research → Multi-format Creation → Visual Design → Distribution
- **Quick Update** (3-5 agents): Quick Write → Review → Publish

### Pipeline Optimization Rules
- SELECT minimum viable agent set for content quality required
- PRIORITIZE speed for time-sensitive content (news, updates)
- MAXIMIZE depth for authority-building content (white papers, guides)
- ADAPT pipeline based on:
  - Content complexity
  - Technical requirements
  - Audience sophistication
  - Time constraints
  - Quality requirements

### Override Triggers
Use FULL PIPELINE (35-41 agents) only when:
- Explicitly requested: "comprehensive pipeline"
- Multi-format deliverable set required
- Enterprise-level content with compliance needs
- Content series requiring consistency framework
- First piece establishing brand voice/style

## AUTHENTICITY REQUIREMENTS
ENSURE all examples and data points follow these standards:
- Mark fictional examples as "representative scenarios" or "composite cases"
- Use phrases like "Consider a typical..." or "In our analysis of common patterns..."
- ANY statistics must be marked as either:
  - [ACTUAL]: From verifiable sources (include source)
  - [PROJECTED]: Based on industry patterns
  - [ILLUSTRATIVE]: For demonstration purposes
- NEVER claim false client relationships or specific company involvement
- Include disclaimer: "Examples are composites based on observed market patterns"
- VALIDATE all claims against reality check: "Could this actually be delivered?"

## SWISS MARKET VALIDATION
VERIFY content meets Swiss business standards:
- Conservative confidence over aggressive claims
- Konkret (specific) examples over vague promises
- Use "could" and "typically" rather than "will" and "always"
- Reference Swiss quality frameworks naturally (ISO, Swiss Made standards)
- Check German business terms are Hochdeutsch not Deutschland-German
- Validate CHF amounts against actual Swiss market rates
- Ensure compliance references are current (check FINMA, FEDPOL updates)
- Respect cantonal differences where relevant
- Include multilingual considerations (DE/FR/IT/EN)

## RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS
RESEARCH and GATHER verified data on:
- [Specific research topics relevant to content]
- Market statistics with SOURCE attribution
- Industry patterns with VERIFICATION method
- Competitor landscape with FACTUAL analysis
- Customer pain points with VALIDATION approach
ANALYZE findings for authenticity and relevance
VERIFY all data points are current and applicable
DOCUMENT sources for fact-checking

- **ANGLE**: Unique perspective that adds value
- **Differentiation**: Clear distinction from existing content
DEVELOP messaging that balances aspiration with realism

## CONTENT GOVERNANCE STANDARDS
ENFORCE these non-negotiable rules:
- NO specific technology stack mentions (Claude, YAML, agent counts)
- NO impossible timeline claims (instant, overnight, automatic)
- NO unsubstantiated ROI promises without "typically" or "up to"
- NO competitive disparagement (focus on our strengths)
- NO regulatory advice (always recommend professional consultation)
- NO jargon without explanation
- MAXIMUM 20% of content can be problems (80% must be solutions/value)
