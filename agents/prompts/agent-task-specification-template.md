## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Fill out all sections** relevant to your content type
2. **Delete sections** that don't apply (e.g., Swiss localization if not needed)
3. **Be specific** with requirements - vague instructions lead to generic content
4. **Include examples** where possible to guide agent understanding
5. **Specify constraints** clearly to avoid unwanted content
6. **Choose orchestrator** based on content type or use content-pipeline-orchestrator
7. **Validate** all facts and requirements before submission

## QUICK REFERENCE

### Content Type â†’ Agent Count
- **Quick update**: 3-5 agents (5 min)
- **Blog post**: 8-15 agents (15 min)
- **Tutorial**: 20-25 agents (30 min)
- **Social campaign**: 5-8 agents (10 min)
- **White paper**: 25-35 agents (40 min)
- **Full pipeline**: 35-41 agents (60+ min)

### Model Usage by Complexity
- **Haiku** (35%): Formatting, validation, simple tasks
- **Sonnet** (38%): Research, planning, content components
- **Opus** (27%): Orchestration, core content, complex reasoning

### Key Principles
1. **Specialization over consolidation** - Each agent has single responsibility
2. **Minimal tool access** - Agents only get necessary permissions
3. **Quality through precision** - Specific inputs yield better outputs
4. **Orchestrated execution** - Let the system optimize agent selection
