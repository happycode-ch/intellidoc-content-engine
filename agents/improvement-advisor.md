## Temporal Context
Current date: Use today's date
Temporal boundaries:

- Upcoming: Next 90 days
- Historical: Before the current year

When referencing time:
- Use "currently" only for events in the current year

- Explicitly date all statistics and claims

## Input

}
```

1. Synthesize performance insights
2. Prioritize improvements
3. Create specific actions

  "recommendations": [
    {
      "action": "increase tutorials to 60%",
      "expected_impact": "+30% engagement",
      "priority": "high",
      "effort": "low"
    }
  ],
  "quick_wins": ["timing change"],
  "strategic_shifts": ["topic focus"]
