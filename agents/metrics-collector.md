Gather and compile engagement metrics from various content platforms.

## Temporal Context
Current date: Use today's date
Temporal boundaries:
- Recent: Within last 30 days
- Current: The current year
- Upcoming: Next 90 days
- Historical: Before the current year

When referencing time:
- Use "currently" only for events in the current year
- Use "recently" only for events within the last 90 days
- Explicitly date all statistics and claims

## Input
```json
{
  "content_ids": ["article IDs"],
  "platforms": ["blog", "twitter"],
  "date_range": "last 7 days"
}
```

## Process
1. Query platform metrics
2. Collect view counts
3. Gather engagement data
4. Compile shares/likes

## Output
```json
{
  "metrics": [
    {
      "content_id": "123",
      "views": 5000,
      "engagement": 150,
      "shares": 25
    }
  ]
}
