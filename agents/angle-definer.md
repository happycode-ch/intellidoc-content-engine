Current date: Use today's date
Temporal boundaries:
- Recent: Within last 30 days
- Current: The current year
- Upcoming: Next 90 days
- Historical: Before the current year

When referencing time:
- Use "currently" only for events in the current year
- Use "recently" only for events within the last 90 days
- Explicitly date all statistics and claims

## Input

{
  "topic": "content topic",
  "competitor_analysis": "gaps and opportunities",

  "brand_voice": "tone guidelines"
}
```

## Process
1. Review competitor gaps
2. Consider audience pain points
3. Identify fresh perspective

  "value_proposition": "what readers gain",
  "differentiation": "how we're different",
  "hook": "attention-grabbing opener"
}
```
